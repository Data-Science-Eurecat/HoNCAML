 What is HONCAML
=================

HONCAML (HOlistic No Code Automated Machine Learning) is a tool aimed to run
automated machine learning pipelines for problems of diferent nature; main
types of pipeline would be:

1. Training the best possible model for the problem at hand
2. Use this model to predict other instances

Focus
=====

HONCAML has been designed having the following aspects in mind:

* Ease of use
* Modularity
* Extensibility
* Simpler is better

Users
=====

There are (at least) two main types of users who could benefit from this tool:

1. **Regular users**: In terms of programming experience and/or machine learning
   knowledge. It would be possible for them to get results in an easy way.
2. **Advanced users**: It is possible to customise experiments in order to
   adapt to a specific use case that a user with previous knowledge would like.

Pipelines
=========

At this moment, the following types of problems are supported:

* Regression
